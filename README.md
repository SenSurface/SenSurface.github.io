These examples present the SenSurface system capabilities
- Left: Concrete capacitive interface connected via USB
- middle: Wood capacitive interface with wireless connection
- Right: Multiples SenSurfaces interfaces are used together. They can be connected using USB, WiFi, or both.

The sensitive surfaces fabrication process and codes are shared in the next section:

## Why ?

This project aim to give tools for everyone to transform inert surfaces aroud him in touch-sensitive surfaces. Today touch sensing surfaces are largely influenced by touchscreens' look and feel and fail to express the physical richness of existing surrounding materials. We hope to give a tool to create new kind of touh interface easily with great customization.

We introduce Sensurfaces, a plug-and-play electronic module that allows to rapidly experiment with touch-sensitive surfaces while preserving the original appearance of materials.
Sensurfaces is composed of plug-and-play modules that can be connected together to expand the size and number of materials composing a sensitive surface.
The combination of Sensurfaces modules allows the creation of small or large multi-material sensitive surfaces that can detect multi-touch but also body proximity, pose, pass, or even human steps.

<!--In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Sensurfaces. We propose a design space describing the factors of Sensurfaces interfaces. Then, through a series of technical evaluations, we demonstrate the capabilities of our system. Finally, we report on two workshops validating the usability of our system.-->
